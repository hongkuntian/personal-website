            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm currently enrolled in McGill's Honours Computer Science program and have a cumulative GPA of 3.64/4.00 👏. I've been introduced to programming in high school and have ever since fallen in love with it. I'm super analytical and detail-oriented, so it's pretty much a match made in heaven! I haven't set my sights on a particular field yet since all the options seem so interesting and I'd like to explore them all. My philosophy in life is to leave the world better than we found it, and every step I take is to further that personal mantra in order to make the world slightly better. 😁</p>
