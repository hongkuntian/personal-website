      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently enrolled in McGill's Honours Computer Science program and
        have a cumulative GPA of 3.64/4.00. <Emoji symbol="✨" /> I've been
        introduced to programming in high school and have ever since fallen in
        love with it. I'm super analytical and detail-oriented, so it's pretty
        much a match made in heaven! I haven't set my sights on a particular
        field yet since all the options seem so interesting and I'd like to
        explore them all. My philosophy in life is to leave the world better
        than we found it, and every step I take is to further that personal
        mantra in order to make the world slightly better. <Emoji symbol="😁" />
